This repository was a proyect made by two classmates and me in the first year estudiying programing. It doesnt use array list because at that point we werent familiar or its wasnt expected us to know about them so we use diferent techniques. Last disclaimer, all the text and variables are in spanish, obiusly, as we study in Spain.

In this proyect we present a version of the clasic game of hangman but adding some complexity to it. We create a sistem used in the arcades with a points sistem and a leaderboard. At the beginning the user is asked to give a user name that will register his points attach to that name. We create two difernte game modes: one to play with random words, with three diferent dificulties, and the other to play with your own words, planed to play with someone else. When you play the game rewards the player with 1000 points for each correct letter and punishing lowering the score by 500 points. With the total result you contend to be in the leaderboard. We stabliced some default users to beat for the players to get more into the game.
